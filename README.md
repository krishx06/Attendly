# Attendly - AI-Powered Smart Attendance Management System for Classrooms

Attendly is a full-stack AI-based attendance management platform that allows teachers to create courses, enroll students, and automatically mark attendance using facial recognition and optional voice recognition.

The platform is designed to simplify classroom attendance workflows through biometric verification, QR-based enrollment, and intelligent attendance tracking.

```

---

## 4. Configure Environment Variables

Create a file:

```text
.streamlit/secrets.toml
```

Add:

```toml
SUPABASE_URL = "your_supabase_project_url"
SUPABASE_KEY = "your_supabase_anon_key"
APP_URL = "https://attendly-py.streamlit.app/"
```

---

## 5. Run the Application

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

---

# Database Tables

The application uses the following Supabase tables:

- `teachers`
- `students`
- `subjects`
- `subject_students`
- `attendance_logs`

Ensure proper Row Level Security (RLS) policies are configured for:

- SELECT
- INSERT
- UPDATE
- DELETE

---

# Attendance Workflow

## Face Recognition Attendance

1. Teacher uploads classroom image
2. System extracts facial embeddings
3. Faces are matched with registered students
4. Attendance candidates are generated
5. Teacher confirms attendance
6. Records are saved to database

---

## Voice Recognition Attendance

1. Student voice embeddings are stored during enrollment
2. Uploaded audio is processed
3. Voice embeddings are compared
4. Matching students are identified
5. Attendance is recorded after validation

---

# Deployment

The project is deployed using:

- Streamlit Community Cloud
- Vercel

## Deployment Checklist

- Push project to GitHub
- Add secrets in Streamlit Cloud
- Set `app.py` as main file
- Configure Supabase credentials
- Verify QR/share links use deployed app URL
